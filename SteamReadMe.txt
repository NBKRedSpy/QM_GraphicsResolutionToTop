Primarily a tool for modders.

In the graphics options resolution dropdown, moves the specified resolution to the top of the list and the highest resolution as the second.

Speeds up changing between a small window for debugging and a large window for playing.

Defaults to 1366 x 768 x 60, but can be configured
